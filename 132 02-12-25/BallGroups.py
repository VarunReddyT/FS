'''In a class of XII, computer teacher asked one of the student 
to perform a task as practical session .

There is a box contains N balls in it, each ball is printed 
with a positive integer. The teacher ask the student to split 
all the balls in the box into ball-groups,
each group should contain exatly S balls.

The student has to pick the ball-groups as follows:
	- the balls should be numbered consecutively.
	e.g., 1,2 3, 4 or 4,5,6,7 etc.

Finally, the student should say whether it is possible to 
split all the balls in the box, into ball-groups accordingly.

Now, its your task to help the student to find whether it is possible or not.
if possible, print "true".
otherwise, print "false".


Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: Two integers N and S, number of balls and size of ball-group.
Line-2: N space separated integers, integers printed on each ball.

Output Format:
--------------
Print a boolean value, whether it is possible to split all the balls into groups.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
8 4
2 6 3 4 3 5 4 5

Sample Output-1:
----------------
true

Explanation:
-------------
Ball-groups are [2,3,4,5] and [3,4,5,6]


Sample Input-2:
---------------
12 3
12 2 9 5 3 4 13 7 6 8 11 7

Sample Output-2:
----------------
true

Explanation:
-------------
Ball-groups are [2,3,4], [5,6,7], [7,8,9] and [11,12,13]


Sample Input-3:
---------------
6 3
2 5 7 3 4 8

Sample Output-3:
----------------
false

Explanation:
-------------
you cannot form ball groups.
