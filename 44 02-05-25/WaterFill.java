/*
A Kid built a structure using building blocks,
by placing the building-blocks adjacent to each other.

A building-block is a vertical alignment of blocks.
	                            ___
here one block each represents  as |_|.

The following structure made up of using building blocks

                          ___
                      __||    ___
                     |||w||__              ___
                  __|||||| w   w  w |_|
              __|||||||_w||w||___________

               0  1   3   4   2   3    2   0   1   0   2

Once the structure is completed, kid pour water(w) on it.

You are given a list of integers, heights of each building-block in a row.
 Now your task How much amount of water can be stored by the structure.

 Input Format:
 -------------
 Space separated integers, heights of the blocks in the structure.

Output Format:
 --------------
 Print an integer,

Sample Input:
-------------
 0 1 3 4 2 3 2 0 1 0 2

Sample Output:
--------------
6

Explanation:
 -----------
In the above structure,  6 units of water (w represents the water in the structure)
can be stored.
