#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
void reverseString(char* str) {
    int n = strlen(str);
    for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {

Example:

#include <stdio.h>
void findMaxMin(int arr[], int size, int* max, int* min) {
    *max = arr[0];
    *min = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > *max) {

        }
        if (arr[i] < *min) {
            *min = arr[i];
        }
    }
}
int main() {
    int arr[] = {3, 5, 1, 8, 4};
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int max, min;
    findMaxMin(arr, size, &max, &min);
    printf("Max: %d, Min: %d\n", max, min); // Output: Max: 8, Min: 1
    return 0;
}

3. Find the Second Largest Element
Write a function to find the second largest element in an array.
Example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>
int findSecondLargest(int arr[], int size) {
    int first = INT_MIN, second = INT_MIN;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > first) {
            second = first;
            first = arr[i];

    printf("%s\n", str); // Output: Hll Wrld
    return 0;
}

5. Simple Calculator
Write a C program to create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should take two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input and output the result of the operation. Ensure to handle division by zero gracefully.
Example:

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char operator;
    double num1, num2;
    printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): ");
    scanf("%c", &operator);
    printf("Enter two operands: ");
    scanf("%lf %lf", &num1, &num2);
    switch (operator) {
        case '+':
            printf("%.2lf + %.2lf = %.2lf\n", num1, num2, num1 + num2);
            break;
        case '-':
            printf("%.2lf - %.2lf = %.2lf\n", num1, num2, num1 - num2);
            break;
        case '*':
            printf("%.2lf * %.2lf = %.2lf\n", num1, num2, num1 * num2);
            break;
        case '/':
            if (num2 != 0)
                printf("%.2lf / %.2lf = %.2lf\n", num1, num2, num1 / num2);
            else
                printf("Division by zero error.\n");
            break;
        default:
            printf("Invalid operator.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
