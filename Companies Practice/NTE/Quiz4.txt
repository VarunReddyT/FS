A. It finds the shortest path between all pairs of nodes  
B. It works only for graphs with non-negative weights  
C. It guarantees the shortest path in all cases

A. Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
B. Depth-First Search (DFS) with recursion stack  
C. Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
D. Kruskal’s Algorithm  
ANSWER: B

Explanation:

10. What is the output of the following function when applied to an undirected graph represented as an adjacency list?

Function BFS(Node start):
    Queue Q
    Add start to Q
    While Q is not empty:
        Node u = Q.dequeue()
        print u
        For each neighbor v of u:
            If v is not visited:
                Mark v as visited
                Add v to Q

A. Breadth First Traversal
B. Depth-First Traversal  
C. Detection of cycles  
D. Finding the minimum spanning tree  
ANSWER: A

Explanation:  
BFS explores level by level, ensuring it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

11. Which of the following SQL statements is used to remove an entire table including its structure?
A. `DELETE TABLE Employees;`  
B. `DROP TABLE Employees;`  
C. `REMOVE TABLE Employees;`  
D. `TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;`  
ANSWER: B) `DROP TABLE Employees;`  
Explanation:  
- `DROP TABLE` completely deletes the table along with its structure.  
- `TRUNCATE TABLE` removes only the data but retains the table structure.  

12. Which of the following SQL commands can be used to modify the structure of an existing table?
A. `UPDATE`  
B. `ALTER`  
C. `MODIFY`  
D. `CHANGE`  
ANSWER: B

Explanation:  
- The `ALTER TABLE` command modifies the structure of a table, such as adding or removing columns.

13. What will happen if we execute the following command?

TRUNCATE TABLE Orders;

A. Deletes all rows but retains the table structure.  
B. Deletes all rows and removes the table structure.  
C. Deletes selected rows only.  
D. Returns an error if there are foreign key constraints.  
ANSWER: A

Explanation:  
- `TRUNCATE` removes all records but preserves the table definition.

14. Which SQL command is used to modify existing data in a table?
A. `ALTER`  
B. `UPDATE`  
C. `INSERT`  
D. `MODIFY`  
ANSWER: B

Explanation:  
- `UPDATE` modifies existing records in a table.  
- `INSERT` adds new records.  

15. Consider the following SQL query:

UPDATE Employees 
SET Salary = Salary + 5000
WHERE Department = 'HR';

What does this query do?
A. Increases all employees’ salary by 5000.  
B. Increases salary of only HR department employees by 5000.  
C. Decreases salary of HR department employees by 5000.  
D. Throws an error due to the `WHERE` clause.  
ANSWER: B

Explanation:  
- The `WHERE` clause ensures that only HR employees are affected.

16. What will happen if you execute the following SQL statement?

INSERT INTO Students (ID, Name) VALUES (101, 'John');
INSERT INTO Students (ID, Name) VALUES (101, 'Mike');

A. Both rows will be inserted successfully.  
B. Only the first row is inserted; the second one causes a Primary Key violation.  
C. The second statement overwrites the first one.  
D. Error due to missing `VALUES` keyword.  
ANSWER: B

Explanation:  
- If `ID` is a PRIMARY KEY, inserting a duplicate violates integrity constraints.

17. Which SQL statement is used to give a user access to a database?
A. `GRANT`  
B. `REVOKE`  
C. `ALTER`  
D. `ACCESS`  
ANSWER: A

Explanation:  
- `GRANT` assigns privileges to users, while `REVOKE` removes privileges.

18. What will be the result of the following SQL statement?
REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE ON Employees FROM user1;

A. `user1` loses all privileges on `Employees`.  
B. `user1` loses INSERT and UPDATE privileges on `Employees`.  
C. `user1` loses SELECT privilege on `Employees`.  
D. Nothing happens.  
ANSWER: B

Explanation:  
- `REVOKE` removes specific privileges assigned by `GRANT`.

19. Which SQL command is used to permanently save a transaction?
A. `ROLLBACK`  
B. `COMMIT`  
C. `SAVEPOINT`  
D. `UPDATE`  
ANSWER: B

Explanation:  
- `COMMIT` saves all changes made in the transaction permanently.

20. Consider the following SQL sequence:

BEGIN;
UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary + 5000 WHERE Department = 'IT';
ROLLBACK;

What will be the final effect of the transaction?
A. The salaries of IT employees will increase by 5000.  
B. No change will happen in the Employees table.  
C. An error occurs because `ROLLBACK` cannot undo an `UPDATE`.  
D. Only half the rows get updated.  
ANSWER: B

Explanation:  
- `ROLLBACK` undoes all changes made since `BEGIN;` was executed.
